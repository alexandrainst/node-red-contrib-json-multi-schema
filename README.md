# node-red-contrib-json-schema
Set of generic JSON data pipeline tools, suitable from continuous/streaming input, and with dynamic configuration.

All the modules are made for [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) but can alternatively be run from command-line using standard input/output.
Matching rules and transformation rules are written in [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) (JSON query and transformation language).

Made by Alexandra Institute <https://alexandra.dk> for the SynchroniCity European project <https://synchronicity-iot.eu> as a contribution to FIWARE <https://www.fiware.org>

Appropriate e.g. for working with [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/developers/data-models/)â€™s [Smart Data Models](https://smart-data-models.github.io/data-models/).


## node-red-contrib-json-multi-transformer
* *Context*: Node-RED node, or command line with [`index-transformer.js`](./index-transformer.js)
* *Purpose*: Ability to transform a JSON observation on the fly from whichever format to another format  (e.g. one of the FIWARE NGSI types) using a specified JSONata Schema URL. Schemas are automatically downloaded and cached the first time they are needed.
* *Configuration*: A Node-RED `transformUrl` property to indicate the URL of a file listing which JSONata file to use for which data input. (See example below).
* *Input*: A JSON observation in whichever format in the `msg.payload` property.
* *Output*: The transformed JSON observation in the `msg.payload` property.

### Example of input data

This is an example of non-standard payload, which needs to be transformed into a standard format.

```json
{
	"id": "vehicle:WasteManagement:1",
	"type": "BasicVehicle",
	"vehicleType": "lorry",
	"category1": "municipalServices",
	"latitude": -3.164485591715449,
	"longitude": 40.62785133667262,
	"name": "C Recogida 1",
	"speed": 50,
	"cargoWeight": 314,
	"serviceStatus": "onRoute",
	"serviceProvided1": "garbageCollection",
	"serviceProvided2": "wasteContainerCleaning",
	"areaServed": "Centro",
	"refVehicleModel": "vehiclemodel:econic",
	"vehiclePlateIdentifier": "3456ABC"
}
```

### Example of configuration file listing the transformations

`query` is a JSONata expression. In this example, it will match the input data above.

```json
[
	{
		"query": "type='BasicVehicle' and latitude",
		"cases": {
			"true": "https://synchronicity.example.net/OldVehicleToVehicle.jsonata.js"
		}
	}
]
```

### Example of JSONata transformation

In the example, this file is hosted at `https://synchronicity.example.net/OldVehicleToVehicle.jsonata.js`

```js
{
	"id": id,
	"type": "Vehicle",
	"vehicleType": vehicleType,
	"category": [
		category1
	],
	"location": {
		"type": "Point",
		"coordinates": [
			longitude,
			latitude
		]
	},
	"name": name,
	"speed": speed,
	"cargoWeight": cargoWeight,
	"serviceStatus": serviceStatus,
	"serviceProvided": [
		serviceProvided1,
		serviceProvided2
	],
	"areaServed": areaServed,
	"refVehicleModel": refVehicleModel,
	"vehiclePlateIdentifier": vehiclePlateIdentifier
}
```


## node-red-contrib-json-multi-schema-resolver
* *Context*: Node-RED node, or command line with [`index-resolver.js`](./index-resolver.js)
* *Purpose*: Ability to determine the URL of the JSON Schema (e.g. FIWARE NGSI) or JSONata schema to use for a given JSON payload received.
* *Input*: A JSON observation (e.g. one of the FIWARE NGSI types) in the `msg.payload` property.
* *Output*: The unmodified JSON observation in the `msg.payload` property, and the resolved schema URL in the `msg.schemaUrl` property.


## node-red-contrib-json-multi-schema-validator
* *Context*: Node-RED node, or command line with [`index-validator.js`](./index-validator.js)
* *Purpose*: Ability to validate a JSON observation (e.g. one of the FIWARE NGSI types) on the fly against a specified JSON Schema URL. Schemas are automatically downloaded and cached the first time they are needed.
* *Input*: A JSON observation (e.g. one of the FIWARE NGSI types) in the `msg.payload` property, and the corresponding JSON Schema URL on the `msg.schemaUrl` property.
* *Output*: The unmodified JSON observation in the `msg.payload` property, and potential validation errors in the `msg.error` property.
* *Implementation*: Based on [AJV](https://ajv.js.org).
